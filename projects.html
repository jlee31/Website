    <h3> International Baccalaureate Documents </h3> <br>
    
    <h4> <a href="Documents/chemia.pdf"> The Relationship between Hydrogen Peroxide with Manganese Dioxide and Sulfuric Acid </a></h4> <br>
      <ul> 
        <li> Determined the rates of reaction and activation energy of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide, manganese dioxide and sulfuric acid. </li>
        <li> This is the <b> Chemistry Internal Assessment </b> I completed for the IB Diploma </li>
      </ul> <br>
    <h4> <a href="Documents/mathia.pdf"> Investigating the Lotka Volterra Predator Prey Equations </a></h4> <br>
      <ul> 
        <li> Investigated the Lotka Volterra Equations that model wolf and moose population dynamics. </li>
        <li> Extended this investigation by modelling the equations with python. </li>
        <li> Further investigation includes working with the Rosenzweig-MacArthur Model or Beddington-DeAngelis Model. </li>
        <li> This is the <b> Math Internal Assessment </b> I completed for the IB Diploma </li> <br>
      </ul>

    <h3> Programming Projects </h3> <br>
    <ul> 
      <li> Simple Games in Pygame -- Python </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Began to learn Game Development using the Python Library Pygame. Games I created include TicTacToe, Pong and a simple Aim Trainer. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Platformer Game -- Python </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Learned more complex details of pygame by following tutorials which helped me learn animations, proper collisions and timers. I enhanced these projects by implementing more features, different controls or file-saving mechanisms. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Monkeys VS Coconut </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Created a single player 2D game where the character is a Monkey who aims to collect Bananas and avoids Coconuts. Uses the pygame library and publicly made assets for the drawings and music.  </li>
      </ul>
      <li> KnockOff StreetFighter -- Python, SQLite, </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Using what I learned, I created a knockoff StreetFighter game which allows two players to pick a character, and fight each other like the popular arcade game. Using my knowledge in Tiled, I also created a custom map with unique characters with different abilities. Using SQLite, I will add a High Score Tracker. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Calculator Applications -- Python</li>
      <ul>
        <li> Designed an implemented a calculator using Python and its libraries such as PySimpleGUI to create a GUI. The calculator is able to perform more than basic arithmetic â€” It also has features to calculate different formulas in Physics, Chemistry and Math. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Data Structures and Algorithms -- Python, C, Racket </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Self Learning certain Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. I apply this knowledge to optimize game mechanics and also solving competitve programming problems. </li>
      </ul>
      <!-- SQL Project -->
      <!-- <li> SQL Project </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Currently Self Learning SQL.</li>
      </ul> -->
      <!-- Programming Project With Bill and Cheb-->
      <!-- <li> Project with Bill and Cheb (In Progress) </li> 
      <ul>
        <li> ... </li>
      </ul> -->
      <li> CS135 Assignments -- Racket </li>
      <ul>
        <li> My Solutions for the CS135 course at the University of Waterloo </li>
      </ul>
      <li> CS136 Assignments -- C </li>
      <ul>
        <li> My Solutions for the CS136 course at the University of Waterloo </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Future Aspirations -- C#/C++</li>
      <ul>
        <li> Once I am more experienced in game development, I aim to expand my horizons by working with different game engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine. I am interested in creating more complex projects in 3-D or potentially working with AI-driven mechanics. </li>
      </ul>
  
    </ul> <br>

    <h3> For Fun (Work in Progress) </h3> <br>
    <ul> 
      <li> Youtube Channel </li>
      <p> During summer of 2024, I decided to create a youtube channel that I would post videos/vlogs of my life as a university student. I thought it would be a fun idea since I could come back to these videos once I graduate. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Monthly Vlogs</li>
        <li> Cooking Videos (Potentially) </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Instagram Exercise Page </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Rock Climbing </li>
        <li> Volleyball </li>
        <li> Gym </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
